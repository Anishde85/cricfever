        description: `After being demolished in less than two days England will be facing India in the fourth test starting on 4th march, 2021.After the 3rd match there were some questions about the pitch conditions,but India clarified the things quite well by giving the justification that 21 wickets out of 30 were on straighter deliveries. In an Interview Indian vice captain Ajinkya Rahane pointed out "Our technique gets critisized abroad, here visitors crib about pitch"-which answers all the questions of the critics.besides this pitch debate, another thing that's quite astonishing is the rotation policy and team selection of the visitors. They were the dominant side in the first test and after that they looked a different side altogether. But they have great talents in their team as well to come back strongly in the 4th test. Let's hope for a great contest. Cheers.`,
