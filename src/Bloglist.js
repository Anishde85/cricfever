        description: `After being demolished in less than two days England will be facing India in the fourth test starting on 4th march, 2021.After the 3rd match there were some questions about the pitch conditions,but India clarified the things quite well by giving the justification that 21 wickets out of 30 were on straighter deliveries. In an Interview Indian vice captain Ajinkya Rahane pointed out "Our technique gets critisized abroad, here visitors crib about pitch"-which answers all the questions of the critics.besides this pitch debate, another thing that's quite astonishing is the rotation policy and team selection of the visitors. They were the dominant side in the first test and after that they looked a different side altogether. But they have great talents in their team as well to come back strongly in the 4th test. Let's hope for a great contest. Cheers.`,

England dominated India in the first t20 whereas India thrashed England in the 2nd t20 . Its now time for the third one who’s gonna take the lead ? Will Ishan Kishan continue to show his fireworks alongside with hitman or will it be Jos Butler for England at the top?

Bowling second hasn’t been upto the mark form both the teams  and dew had an heavy impact of the outcome of the game . So who’s gonna take a crucial lead in the series today?`,
